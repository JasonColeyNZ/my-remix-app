<p>Platelet Rich Plasma, also known as "PRP" is an injection treatment whereby a person's own blood is used. A fraction of blood (20cc) is drawn up from the individual patient into a syringe. This is a relatively small amount compared to blood donation which can remove 500cc. The blood is spun in a special centrifuge to separate its components ( Red Blood Cells, Platelet Rich Plasma, Platelet Poor Plasma and Buffy Coat).The Platelet Rich Plasma and Buffy Coat is first separated and combined then activated with a small amount of calcium gluconate which acts as an activation agent and scaffold to keep the PRP where the injector intends to treat. Platelets are very small cells in your blood that are involved in the clotting and healing process. When PRP is injected into the damaged area it causes a mild inflammation that triggers the healing cascade. As the platelets organize in the treatment area they release a number of enzymes to promote healing and tissue responses including attracting stem cells and growth factors to repair the damaged area. As a result new collagen begins to develop. As the collagen matures, it begins to shrink causing the tightening and strengthening of the damaged area. When treating injured or sun and time damaged tissue, they can induce a remodeling of the tissue to a healthier and younger state. The full procedure takes approximately 45 minutes to an hour. Generally 2-3 treatments are advised,however, more may be necessary for some individuals. Touch up treatments may be done once a year after the initial group of treatments to boost and maintain the results.'</p>
<p><strong>Safety Information</strong></p>
<p>PRP'S SAFETY has been established for over 20 years for its wound healing properties and it's proven effectiveness has extended across multiple medical specialties including cardiovascular surgery, orthopedics, sports medicine, podiatry, ENT, neurosurgery, dental and maxillofacial surgery (dental implants and sinus elevations), urology, dermatology (chronic wound healing), and ophthalmology, cosmetic surgery. PRP's emergence into aesthetics and skin rejuvenation began i n 2004 in Europe, Asia, Australia, and South America in countries such as The United Kingdom, Japan, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland and Argentina to name a few. Areas typically treated for aesthetic purposes and skin rejuvenation include: Crinkling skin around the eyes, cheeks and mid face, neck, jaw-line, chest and d&eacute;colletage, back of hands and arms, lips, and to stimulate hair growth on scalp. Almost all skin tones show that PRP is safe and effective because your own enriched plasma is used.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>
<p>Along with the benefit of using your own tissue therefore virtually eliminating allergies, there is the added intrigue of mobilizing your own stem cells for your benefit. PRP has been shown to have overall rejuvenating effects on the skin including: improving skin texture, thickness, fine lines and wrinkles, increasing volume via the increased production of collagen and Elastin, and by diminishing and improving the appearance of scars. The most dramatic results to date have been the "crepy" skin problems in areas such as under the eyes, neck, and d&eacute;colletage. It is not designed to replace cosmetic surgery as there are some cases where those procedures would be more appropriate.</p>
<p>Other benefits include: minimal down time, safe with minimal risk, short recovery time, natural looking results; no general anesthesia is required.</p>
