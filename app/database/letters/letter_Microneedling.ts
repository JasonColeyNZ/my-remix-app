export const microneedling = `<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">I hereby authorize my practitioner or any delegated associates to perform Microneedling Therapy. I understand that this procedure is purely elective.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What to Expect:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Depending on the area of your face or body being treated and the type of device used (i.e. needle length), the procedure is well-tolerated and in some cases virtually painless, feeling only a mild prickling sensation.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your practitioner will apply a topical anesthetic to your skin prior to treatment to reduce any pain and discomfort.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your skin will be pink or red in appearance, much like a sunburn, for a couple of hours following treatment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minor bleeding and bruising is possible depending on the length of the needle used and the number of times it is pressed across the treatment area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your skin may feel warm, tight, and itchy for a short while. This should subside in 12-48 hours.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Possible Side-Effects:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Side effects or risks are minimal with this type of treatment and typically include minor flaking or dryness of the skin with scab formation in rare cases.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Milia (small white bumps) may form; these can be removed by the practitioner.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hyper-pigmentation (darkening of certain areas of the skin) can occur very rarely and usually resolves after a month.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have a history of cold sores, this procedure may cause flare ups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Temporary redness and mild-sunburn effects may last up to 4 days.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Freckles may temporarily lighten or permanently disappear in treated areas.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other potential risks include: crusting, itching, discomfort, bruising, infection, swelling, and failure to achieve the desired result. Permanent scarring (less than 1%) is extremely rare.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
