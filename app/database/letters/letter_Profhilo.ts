export const profhilo = `<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">You have decided to undergo treatment with Profhilo /Skinbooster - a clear, absorbable,non-animal hyaluronic acid gel that is injected into the facial tissue for a skin-enhancing effect.</p>
<p>Profhilo/Skinbooster is injected superficially into the skin to tighten, rejuvenate the skin and counteract laxity in the long term. Profhilo/Skinbooster strengthens, moisturizes the skin and restores aging tissue that begins to lose elasticity. Results last up to approximately 6 months after a course, but may vary depending on skin type, treated area and amount of product injected. The desired effect can be maintained with follow-up treatments. Initially, 2-3 treatments are recommended and then repeated with a single treatment after 6 months. Depending on the area to be treated, anesthesia can be added with an anesthetic cream. Before the treatment, all make-up is removed and the area is disinfected. After the injection, skin reactions such as redness and swelling may occur, which in some cases may be accompanied by itching and soreness. Bruising can also occur in connection with the needle stick. These reactions are completely transient and usually subside within 3-7 days. Small calluses or small lumps may form at the injection site. In very rare cases, injection of hyaluronic acid can cause discoloration of the injection site, occlusion of blood vessels, wart formation, granuloma, and hypersensitivity. If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, you should not be treated with Profhilo Injection with Prophilo/Skinboosters. If the symptoms of redness, swelling or other symptoms last more than 7 days, you should contact your doctor.</p>
