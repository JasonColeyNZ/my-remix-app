export const botulinumtoxin = `<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"><strong>INDICATIONS AND ALTERNATIVES</strong></p>
<p>Botox is a brand name for botulinum toxin type A, a neurotoxin that blocks messages between muscles and the nerves that control them. The effects of Botox become apparent 2-5 days after injection and generally last for 4-6 months. The FDA has approved the use of Botox to treat facial dystonias (spasms), strabismus (crossed eyes), and to temporarily soften facial rhytids (wrinkles) between the eyebrows. While the FDA has not approved injections to improve the appearance of wrinkles in other areas of the face, physicians may perform these &ldquo;off-label&rdquo; procedures. There are alternatives to Botox, including no treatment, or medicines or surgery on my facial nerves and muscles.</p>
